## PostgreSQL local setup

- Either install Postgres.app (for Mac users only) or native PostgreSQl Installer.
- Upon successful installation, intialize the Postgres server locally. By default it runs on port 5432.
- Command to connect to Postgres database.

```
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U username -d databaseName
```

> PSQL isÂ a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL.

> Note: We cannot using ElephantSql in the scope of this project because whenever PRISMA creates migration it needs access to create a temporary table in our DB which is not possible in the case of ElephantSQL database.
