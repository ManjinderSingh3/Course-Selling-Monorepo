## PostgreSQL local setup

- Either install Postgres.app (for Mac users only) or native PostgreSQl Installer.
- Upon successful installation, intialize the Postgres server locally. By default it runs on port 5432.
- Command to connect to Postgres database.

```
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U username -d databaseName
```

> PSQL isÂ a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL.

> Note: We cannot using ElephantSql in the scope of this project because whenever PRISMA creates migration it needs access to create a temporary table in our DB which is not possible in the case of ElephantSQL database.

### Current Issues/ Pending work

- ENV varibales are not accessible
- Create .env.example file
- Until the project is not deployed. Set localhost 3000 as a base URL in config.ts file instead of using the same base url in code everywhere. (Something like this:
  export const BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000")
- Deplyment on Vercel. The current deployment workflow has to be fixed. It is failing at the moment.
- Migrate entire data from MongoDB to Postgres
